# RPG Maker 2003 Clean Project

When creating a new project, RPG Maker 2003 includes many entries in the database, and requires the use of RTP. Using personal resources requires a tedious cleanup of the database in every new project.

This blank project saves you from doing this step. It doesn't need RTP, and only contains the mandatory files to launch the game. The database is fully cleaned up, except for the glossary.

## Customization

You can remove `CharSet/Vehicles.png` by setting another charset for the vehicles in the database.

An easy way to check if your game needs RTP files is by renaming the RTP folder in your RPG Maker 2003 installation. If your game still runs fine, you're good to go!
